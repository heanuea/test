# QuickFireMAths Windows App 

To create a Windows Universal App, the app i created is a quick quiz on basic maths with two different difficulties 

## Running the Application 

Download the app from github and open the project in visual studio

## **_Languages Used_**

### **XAML**
XAML is used to the design the User Interface or "Views" of the application. These are the areas the user interacts with. The pages that have been created using XAML in this project are as follows:

### **C#**
The C# Programming language is what provides this application with its functionality. The logic behind all the XAML page views and more is all written using the C# language, hence
every XAML page has a corresponding C# class behind it. A breakdown of the indiviual C# classes for this project is as follows:



## **_Deployment For Visual Studio 2015_**
* [Visual Studio 2017 ](https://www.visualstudio.com//) - The framework used
- Download the zip file provided.
- Open the project .sln file using Visual Studio 2015.
- You may need to follow the steps to install SQLite that were decribed earlier. Id imagine though that it will come as part of the project.
- Run the project.
- If there any difficulties dont hesitate to contact me on my student email. If the online scores are not working the server is most likely switched off. Let me know and i can switch it back on.
